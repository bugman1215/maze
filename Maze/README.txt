This is a game in 3D maze.
You may control the player cube's movement via "w" "s" "a" "d" or "up" "down" "left" "right", press esc to pause the game anytime and restart.
Be careful, there will be ghosts chasing and attacking you. Avoid them and eat fruits  on your way to make sure you survive, reach the exit of the maze and you win! (if you die halfway, you lose)
